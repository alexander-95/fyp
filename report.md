###Development of an Asynchronous Stereo Vision Technique to be Implemented in a Visual Radar Tracking System

##1.Abstract

##2.Introduction
introduction to the addressed topic:
The topic being addressed by this project is stereo computer vision, the use of 2 cameras to get information in a 3D environment. My project specifically focuses on the implementation of an asynchronous technique.

motivation, why people should care, what are you trying to achieve:
In a typical stereo vision setup, the assumption is made that each camera is taking photos at the same time. This cannot be the case in a single threaded application. My project avoids this assumption by taking photos asynchronously(at different times).
